# Stock-market-desktop-notifier
This program fetches real-time stock market data for a specific stock, in this case, Tesla (TSLA), and displays it as a desktop notification every 2 hours using the Alpha Vantage API. The notification includes the current stock price, the lowest price reached during the day (day low), and the highest price reached during the day (day high) (day high).

The program runs in an infinite loop, continuously retrieving updated stock data and displaying it as a desktop notification. This can be useful for someone who is interested in monitoring the stock market and wants to stay up-to-date on the latest stock prices without having to constantly check a website or application.
